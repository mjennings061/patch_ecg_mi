# Patch-Based ECG Development

## Background
The 12-lead \gls{ecg} is the most prevalent tool in clinical use to detect acute cardiac syndromes. 
In particular, myocardial infarction and related ischaemic disorders. 
This lead system is inconvenient for ambulatory use, especially when detecting paroxysmal conditions. 
A patch-based lead system is more convenient for these use-cases. 
There is a lack of such lead systems that are specific to \gls{st}-segment monitoring, so one must be derived. 
In particular, the use of a \gls{ssl} patch with lead spacing of 100 mm or less would be sufficiently comfortable while allowing the wearer to undertake ambulatory tasks. 
In this project, we aim to introduce and evaluate the use of a \gls{ssl} patch-based lead system suitable for \gls{st}-segment monitoring. 

## Usage

To run this project, open MATLAB R2021b or greater and run the `main.m` file:

```shell
main()
```

Please note, this takes several minutes to run.

## Funding

The work carried out as part of this project has been funded by the Special European Union Programmes Body (SEUPB) as part of the INTERREG VA scheme. 
Additionally, the SEUPB have funded the creation of the Eastern Corridor Medical Engineering centre (ECME) with 24 Ph.D and 5 post-doctoral researchers.
